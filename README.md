This is ShapeChat, the final project for my Live Web class, taken in Spring 2022 at NYU's IMA program. It is a chat app in which users can chat anonymously but be identified by the color of their message and the bubble around it, of which they are fully in control. This app uses websockets to send and receive the messages between users, and stores the messages in a JSON database, since the next logical step would be to enable separate chatrooms with their own chat histories and to allow a user to have multiple conversations with different users instead of one big chat. The name "ShapeChat" was given because the original intention was to have the users identify themselves through text bubbles of different shapes, but I found it easier to understand the conversation when all the text bubbles are the same shape and it's just the colors that are different; however, "ShapeChat" had a nice ring to it that "ColorChat" didn't have, so I stuck with the name. The website is hosted on Glitch and can be accessed [here](https://liveweb-final-andres.glitch.me/).
